           <h1>History</h1>
                <p>Roller Coasters and Theme Parks have been around for a <strong>long</strong> time! They've gotten more extreme and more intense in the recent years, and designers are continuing to push the limits on these incredible creations!<br></p>
                <p>But that begs the question: How did these contraptions come to be? What was their inspiration? How did they become the intense thrill machines we know today? Let's take a dive and find out!</p>
            <h2>Unique Beginnings</h2>
                <p>The origin of Roller Coasters might suprise you. The first "roller coaster" was found in St. Petersburg, Russia as a simple ice ramp that people would ride sleds down! This would be the inspiration for the next leap forward!</p>
                <p>A French travel saw this unique concept and built on it, erecting a track with grooves down the middle, allowing a bench with wheels to fit in the groove and run down the track. This was known as"The Promenades-AÃ©riennes" or "The Aerial Walk" in Paris. Also, <em>it ran sidways!</em></p>

            <h2>Switchback Railway</h2>
                <p>Even though roller coasters were inspired by these ice sleds, in the 19th century, technology evolved and people started using <strong>Railroad Tracks</strong> with cars that were locked to the track. In 1884, a man named La Marcus Thompson, also known as the <em>"Father of the roller Coaster"</em> built the <strong>Switchback Railway</strong> at Coney Island. This was considered the first <em>modern</em> roller coaster in America. It was extremely simple: You start at the top and ride down a few hills, reaching daunting speeds of <em>6 miles per hour.</em></p>
