            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is Dallin Curtis! I've been a <strong>MAJOR</strong> coaster nerd my whole life! To me, nothing beats the pure adrenaline rush I feel when I'm strapped on a roller coaster, flying through all kinds of manuevers and feeling the intensity as I travel through these beautiful creations! I also can't help but admire a well-themed park! It started when I took my first ride on <em>"Rock-N-Roller Coaster"</em> at Disney World. Since then, I've been hooked on roller coasters. I've visted many theme parks and have ridden TONS of coasters!</p>

            <h2>Why did I create Coaster Quest?</h2>
                <p>I created this page because I want to share my love of roller coasters and theme parks! I've learned a lot over my years of being an enthusiast, and I want to share it with those who want to learn more about these beautiful creations! I want to share:</p>
